            <h1>Factris design system</h1>
            <p>A component based UI library for designers and developers for a brand new digital web-app.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="goal">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>In June 2019 we've released the first version of a factoring web-app (<a href="factris-mvp.html">see case
                    study</a>). The need for a consistent foundation of UI components and patterns resulted in a deep
                collaboration between the front-end developers and designers.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>An effective design system solves boring, repeatable problems so that developers and designers can focus
                on more creative and challenging tasks.</p>
            <p>Following the atomic design principles we've build into the system mostly ions, atoms and molecules at
                the beginning, we wanted to try and test new ideas in the product before incorporating them into the
                system. This approach helped us to stay away from the classic design system conundrum of being overly
                prescriptive and constraining.</p>
            <p>Once a pattern or idea has been proven to be effective, reusable, and tested in edge cases, we can
                extract it from the product interfaces and add it to the design system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Tooling</h2>
            <p>The frontend team chose Storybook as the tool for UI development, testing, and documentation, which
                worked well with Figma, the design team's choice.</p>
            <p>I found this to be a good solution for both teams, as it allowed us to work in our respective areas of
                expertise. Developers could use Storybook to access tested components, mock API calls, and ready-to-use
                code, while designers could use Figma's assets library and detach components as needed to experiment
                with new ideas.</p>
            <p> Overall, this setup enabled us to collaborate effectively and efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As a designer, it is essential to work closely with the front-end team, as the users of our products will
                interact with the production environment, not the beautifully crafted Figma prototype.</p>
            <p>Building a design system is a step towards the goal of making our clients, and ultimately the end-users,
                happy. It has been shown that a well-designed and consistent design system leads to faster release
                cycles and better user experiences, as users appreciate predictability and consistency in the products
                they use.</p>
